# Weliyek

Weli yek means to be skilled, to be powerful in Nawat, a indigenous
language spoken in El Salvador [1].

Weliyek is the umbrella term for all the software in this repository. For now
only serialization logic is present.

To do:

- [x] Import serialization code
- [ ] Refactor serialization code
- [ ] Add Bitcoin serialization logic
- [ ] Add Bitcoin protocol client
- [ ] Add Bitcoin test infrastructure using docker.

Later will look into creating a client that will be able to connect to a
Bitcoin node. 

### Unit Tests

See the following unit test for examples how the serialization is performed. Also see 
FilterBuilderTest.java for an example on how a search can be done.

- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.amat.basic.aggregator.sequence.DynamicCollectionFieldTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.amat.basic.aggregator.sequence.FixedAndVariableSizeCollectionFieldsTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.amat.basic.number.PrimitiveSerializationTests.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.amat.basic.string.StringWithDynamicSizeBytesTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.amat.basic.string.StringWithFixedLengthBytesTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.ketza.util.array.ByteArrayWrapperTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/welikey.ketza.util.array.DynamicByteArrayTest.java
- weliyek/lib/src/test/java/weliyek.amat2.protocol.filter.FilterBuilderTest.java

To run the test, clone this Git repo and import the code as a Gradle project. Two projects then
should be available, weliyek and lib. Gradle should retrieve all necessary dependencies
automatically. Once that's done, the unit tests above can be executed as JUnit tests. This has
been tested only in Eclipse.
