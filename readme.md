# Weliyek

Weli yek means to be skilled, to be powerful in Nawat, a indigenous
language spoken in El Salvador [1].

Weliyek is the umbrella term for all the software in this repository. For now
only serialization logic is present.

To do:

- [*] Import serialization code
- [ ] Refactor serialization code
- [ ] Add Bitcoin serialization logic
- [ ] Add Bitcoin protocol client
- [ ] Add Bitcoin test infrastructure using docker.

Later will look into creating a client that will be able to connect to a
Bitcoin node.
